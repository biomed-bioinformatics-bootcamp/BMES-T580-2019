# Module 8: The Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Objectives:

### Understanding basic programming concepts
 - Using `lambda` functions to encapsulate and pass program logic 
 - Using `yield` to create generators

### Understanding modern data science tools
 - Starting, running, and saving Jupyter Notebooks
 - Running commands interactively in the notebook
 - Using Markdown to style notebooks and add non-code content
 - Exporting notebooks to PDF format
  
  
## PreClass Assignment

## Assignment (due 7/21/19)

The Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab systems have become the industry standard the data science community. 
These systems are generic web servers that function as intermedaries between the user and the underlying python kernel.
Utilizing a webserver and browser as the front-end transparently allows the backend to be moved between local computers, cloud servers, and high performance clusters without any additional end-user setup.
Companies like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [Google](https://colab.research.google.com) host runnable Notebooks as well as ready access to vast libraries of publically accessible data.
This has democratized access to high-performance computing allowing anyone with programming knowledge to take full advantage of the available resources.
In this assignment we will explore the basics of using the Jupyter Lab locally before moving into the cloud.

For this assignment we will re-implement the [Module 5](../Module05/Readme.md) using the Jupyter Notebook.
Make a Jupyter Notebook that has the following features.

1. Has pre-defined variables for inclusion/exclusion criteria.
 - User input through the Notebook is beyond the scope of the course.
 - Use Markdown and comments to adequetly explain the coding of the pre-defined variables.
2. Implement the relevant functions, for-loops, and program logic in the Jupyter Notebook as distinct cells.
3. Use Markdown cells to describe the algorithm and the results.
4. Export the Notebook as a PDF and upload it to BBLearn.
