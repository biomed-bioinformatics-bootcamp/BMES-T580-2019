## Assignment (due 7/24/19)

Pandas has rapidly become the go-to Swiss Army knife of python-based data scientists.
Originally designed for the financial sector, its robust code-base and ever expanding feature has attracted developers and scientists looking to get the most out of their data analysis.
Pandas encapsulates all of the "Spreadsheet" logic of Excel into a simple, and eventually, intuitive interface.
In this assignment we will explore a simple dataset of `TBD` using Pandas.
