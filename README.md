# Syllabus

## Description
This course will teach the basic concepts behind Python programming using hands on examples from taken from real-world biomedical problems. 
This course is designed to provide students without previous programming knowledge guided ramp for learning the many aspects of programming including data analysis, file handing, version control, and task automation. 

## Prerequisites
_None._

## Course Learning Outcomes
- Have an ability to use Python to solve simple data analysis tasks.
- Understand best practices in code management, version control, and reproducible research.
- Implement common programming patterns for handling biological data.
- Have an ability to generate graphs from data using Python.

## Course Structure

This is a Bootcamp style 5-week course. 
As such, we will cover 2 topics per week and it is generally expected that you will be working on this content everyday.

We will follow along with the [Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_python_jumpstart/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps).
While it is not *required* that you purchase the course, it is highly recommended as I will be refering to content discussed in the web-videos.

This course will be managed through [Git Classroom](https://github.com/) with BBLearn being used for class announcements and grade tracking.
Students will submit assigments through Github and will comment on fellow peer's code through a semi-structured code-review process. 
This will help students learn good code management techniques as well as develop a Github portfolio that will be attractive to future employers and instil good habits early.

## Course Grading

Each module will be graded equally on a 100 point scale that will be averaged across all modules to calculate a final grade.
Rubrics are included in each module and detail the specific point distribution for each assignment.
Letter grades will be assigned using the standard Drexel scale.
